Hack the North Project 2019 - HonestNews

Inspiration:

Finding reliable and credible news sources has become an increasingly more difficult task to accomplish. Being able to judge whether a news article is honest is often overlooked, especially when the headlines of articles are written less for accuracy, and more to attract clicks. 

What it does:

This webapp and chrome extension displays a figure from 0-100 on a sliding colour scale of red to green beside the headline of every news article from a google search.

Goal:

To give a quantifiable measure of reliability and honesty, allowing users to compare articles to obtain only the most reliable, credible, and honest sources of information. 

Criteria used to judge the honesty/reliability of the news articles include:

1. Presence of citations
2. Presence of "opinion" words such as "I think"
3. Amount of filler/fluff text
4. Referencing of image captions
5. Embedded video links if references to videos are present
6. Image originality (e.g. clipart/stock photos versus authentic photographs)
5. Site reliability (taken from average scores of articles from the same news source) 
6. Author reliability (taken from average scores from the same author)
