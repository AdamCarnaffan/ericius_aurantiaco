# HonestNews

## Inspiration

Finding reliable and credible news sources has become an increasingly more difficult task to accomplish. Being able to judge whether a news article is honest is often overlooked, especially when the headlines of articles are written less for accuracy, and more to attract clicks. 

## What it is 

This webapp and chrome extension displays a figure from 0-100 on a sliding colour scale of red to green, along with a sad-meh-happy emoji beside the headline of every news article from a google search.

## Goal

To give a quantifiable measure of reliability and honesty, allowing users to compare articles to obtain only the most reliable, credible, and honest sources of information. 

Criteria used to judge the honesty/reliability of the news articles include:

- Presence of citations
- Presence of "opinion" words such as "I think"
-  Amount of filler/fluff text
- Referencing of image captions
- Embedded video links if references to videos are present
- Image originality (e.g. clipart/stock photos versus authentic photographs)
-  Site reliability (taken from average scores of articles from the same news source) 
- Author reliability (taken from average scores from the same author)
